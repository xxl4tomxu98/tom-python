# LIST COMPREHENSION

"""
In this problem, write a function named "eod_comprehension" that accepts a list of integers as a parameter and returns a new list with performs interger division on all of the integers from the original list by 5.

The function must use a list comprehension in its implementation.

Your function body must contain only one line.

There are two sample data calls for you to use.

# WRITE YOUR FUNCTION HERE

  return [i//5 for i in list]

# TEST DATA
test = [204, 4, 5, 101, 66]
print(eod_comprehension(test))  # > [40, 0, 1, 20, 13]

test = []
print(eod_comprehension(test))  # > []
