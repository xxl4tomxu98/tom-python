# W18D4 Objectives



## Migrations With Alembic


> With migrations we generate files and put database table and column declarations (or drops) in the migration files through our models. By the end of today, you should be able to:

* Install Alembic into your project;
* Configure Alembic to talk to your database and use semantic naming;
* Control Alembic's ability to upgrade and downgrade your database;
* Reason about the way Alembic orders your migrations; and,
* Handle branching and merging concerns.



## Using Alembic With Flask


> Using the migration tool for SQLAlchemy, Alembic, you now know how to:

* Install and configure Alembic to work with Flask
* Use the flask db command from Flask-Migrate to manage your migrations
* Autogenerate migrations from model classes that you needed to create anyway!
