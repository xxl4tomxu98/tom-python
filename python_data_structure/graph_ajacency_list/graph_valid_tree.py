'''Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes),
write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.
Example 1:
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [1,4]]
Output: false
Before solving the problem, we have to know the definitions of Tree vs Graph:
A tree is a special undirected graph. It satisfies two properties
1) It is connected. No separate regions. 2) It has no cycle.
Being connected means you can start from any node and reach any other node. To prove it,
we can do a DFS and add each node we visit to a set. After we visited all the nodes,
we compare the number of nodes in the set with the total number of nodes. If they are 
the same then every node is accessible from any other node and the graph is connected.
To prove an undirected graph having no cycle, we can also do a DFS. If a graph contains
a cycle, then we would visit a certain node more than once. There is a minor caveat, 
since the graph is undirected, when we visit a child we would always add parent to the 
next visit list. This creates a trivial cycle and not the real cycle we want. We can avoid
detecting trivial cycle but adding an additional parent state in the DFS call.
We can check both properties in one DFS call since cycle detection always keeps track of
a visited set.'''
