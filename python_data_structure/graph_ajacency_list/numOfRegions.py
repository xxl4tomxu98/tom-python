'''Number of groups formed in a graph of friends
Given n friends and their friendship relations, find the total number of groups that exist. 
And the number of ways of new groups that can be formed consisting of people from every 
existing group. If no relation is given for any person then that person has no group and 
singularly forms a group. If a is a friend of b and b is a friend of c, then a b and c form a group.

Examples:

Input : Number of people = 6
        Relations : 1 - 2, 3 - 4 and 5 - 6
Output: Number of existing Groups = 3
        Number of new groups that can
        be formed = 8
Explanation: The existing groups are
(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6). The new 8 groups
that can be formed by considering a
member of every group are (1, 3, 5),
(1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 6), (2,
3, 5), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 5) and (2, 4, 6).

Input:  Number of people = 6
        Relations : 1 - 2 and 2 - 3
Output: Number of existing Groups = 2
        Number of new groups that can
        be formed = 3
Explanation: The existing groups are
(1, 2, 3) and (4). The new groups that
can be formed by considering a member
of every group are (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4).
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
To count number of groups, we need to simply count connected components in the given 
undirected graph. Counting connected components can be easily done using DFS or BFS.
Since this is an undirected graph, the number of times a Depth First Search starts from 
an unvisited vertex for every friend is equal to the number of groups formed.
To count number of ways in which we form new groups can be done using simply formula 
which is (N1)*(N2)*â€¦.(Nn) where Ni is the no of people in i-th group.
Time complexity: O(N + R) where N is the number of people and R is the number of relations.
